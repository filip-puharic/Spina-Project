# [Špina-Bar](https://spina-bar.netlify.app/)

Špina Bar is my first project with purpose. It is a fully responsive, single page designed website for the most popular cocktail bar in Makarska, Croatia.

It contains most important informations with lots of interesting facts about bar which could attract potential guests.

Furthermore, the site also contains a menu, so guests can know what the bar has at its disposal.

It is adapted to work on all devices (mobile phones, tablets, computers ...) and is therefore available to everyone anytime and anywhere.

The contact section contains the most important informations which includes the reservation number, e-mail, opening hours, address and
links to social networks.

On the other hand, there is a form if the guest has an inquiry so that the bar is always available, which has a positive effect on the interaction between the guests and the bar itself.

At the bottom there is a map with the google location of Špina and in the footer there is a recognition from the tripadvisor where guests can see that it is a professional bar with lots of positive reviews.

Also, a QR code has been created which, when scanned, takes the guest to the menu section, which excludes the use of traditional menus with which many guests interact, and thus leads to reducing the chances of coronavirus infection.
