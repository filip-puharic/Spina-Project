# Špina-Bar

Špina Bar is my first project with purpose. It is a fully responsive, single page designed website for the most popular cocktail bar in Makarska, Croatia.

It was developed with Bootstrap framework.

With animate.css the website uses animations for attention-guiding hints on hero section.

Also, with some basic JavaScript, I made the website more user friendly for inter activity on menu section.

Fancybox is a lightbox I used to make my gallery images touch-enabled.
